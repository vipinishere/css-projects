# Full Stack Developer's CSS Projects Repository

Welcome to my CSS projects repository!

As a full-stack developer, I've delved deep into both frontend and backend technologies. However, I've recently returned to CSS to refine my skills and explore advanced concepts in styling and design.

This repository contains all the CSS projects I've worked on since I started my journey into web development back in 2022. I began learning CSS through Dr. Angela Yu's Udemy course, and I've been honing my skills ever since.

## Background

I embarked on my web development journey in 2022 under the guidance of Dr. Angela Yu through her Udemy course. Since then, I've been exploring the world of front-end development, with a particular focus on CSS.
